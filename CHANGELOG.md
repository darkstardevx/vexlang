# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Added a structured IR verifier (`IR001` invariant failures and `IR002`
  deferred-feature failures) that runs before `build`/`ir` artifacts are
  rendered.
- Documented the native lowering subset and runtime/backend contract.
- Added the first native target contract (`vex-scalar-v1`), target validator,
  `TextBackend` emitter, and `target` CLI command.
- Added a backend trait boundary and an experimental `QbeBackend`/`qbe` CLI
  command for the verified scalar subset without producing fake native
  executable artifacts.
- Hardened experimental QBE scalar runtime semantics with distinct generated
  traps for i32 overflow (`101`), division by zero (`102`), and signed division
  overflow (`103`).
- Expanded compiled-vs-interpreted QBE conformance coverage for scalar
  arithmetic, control flow, functions, booleans, and runtime traps.
- Added reusable QBE install/smoke scripts, QBE backend documentation, and
  `u64` target design notes.
- Added `--json` / `--diagnostic-format=json` machine-readable source
  diagnostics for CLI tooling, with label support for secondary source ranges.

## 0.1.0-alpha.1

- Hardened public-alpha release metadata with `vexlang --version`,
  package consistency checks, reproducible source artifacts, and checksums.
- Added deterministic textual-IR and release smoke coverage and a documented
  publish checklist. Native binaries are intentionally not produced.

## Unreleased (alpha)

- Added enum/Result `match` expressions, wildcard and binding patterns,
  exhaustiveness diagnostics, and interpreter Result propagation with `?`.
  Match/propagation textual-IR lowering is deferred until sum-value control
  flow is represented in the IR.
- The REPL now preserves successful bindings/functions, supports multiline
  input and inspection/loading commands, and rolls back failed snippets.
- Added typed array collections: `[1, 2, 3]`, `[i32]` annotations, empty and
  nested arrays, zero-based indexing, indexed mutation, bounds/type diagnostics,
  and textual IR lowering. Maps and generics remain deferred.
- Stabilized parsing and AST construction for the core expression language.
- Added precedence-aware arithmetic, comparisons, unary minus, variables, and
  `let` declarations.
- Added evaluator environments, overflow and division-by-zero checks, and
  structured CLI errors.
- The CLI now reads a source file or stdin instead of evaluating hardcoded
  source.
- Earlier incomplete QBE code-generation path was disabled while the
  interpreter was being established.
- Added boolean short-circuiting, typed conditional blocks, `if`/`else`, and
  `while` loops.
- Added integer annotation range checks and removed unsupported declaration
  syntax from the active grammar.
- Added mutable assignment so loops can update program state.
- Added `break` and `continue` with loop-only semantic validation, nested
  control-flow propagation, and a one-million-iteration safety limit.

Vex remains an alpha prototype; syntax and APIs may change.

The planned map mutation and iteration work remains deferred until collection
types share a common representation; non-string keys are not silently added.

## Unreleased

- Added user-defined record declarations (`record Name { field: type, ... }`),
  record construction, validated field access, interpreter support, and
  textual-IR lowering. Collections, modules, structured errors/results, and
  project configuration remain deferred.

- Added typed function declarations, calls, returns, recursion, scoped
  parameters, argument/return checking, and call-depth protection.
- Added distinct `u64` runtime values and checked `i32`/`u64` conversions.
- Added string literals plus `print` and `println` built-ins.
- Deferred user-defined types, collections, filesystem access, and modules.
- Added structured diagnostics with stable codes, source underlines,
  line/column locations, and actionable suggestions.
- Added `check`, `run`, `fmt`, `test`, and explicit unsupported `build` CLI
  commands while preserving the legacy file argument form.
- Milestone 8: added typed lowering to a deterministic textual IR exposed by
  `build` and `ir`. Machine-code executable artifacts remain intentionally
  deferred.
- Milestone 9: added interpreter/IR compatibility coverage, stable CLI
  diagnostic and generated-input tests, an opt-in performance smoke test, and
  release-readiness policy documentation.
- Public-release preparation: selected the MIT license, added a private
  security contact, and defined the `0.1.0-alpha.1` release as an alpha
  interpreter and typed-IR prototype.
